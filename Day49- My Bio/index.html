        <small>Electrical And Electronics Engineer</small>
        <p>I am Randhir Shaw, from kolkata. Corrently I'm persuing under graduation in Electrical And Electronics Engineering from Swami Vivekananda Institute of Science and Technology. My long term goal is by gaining work experience of  5-6 years in the field of Software Engineer or Developer, I wish to work in senior position, contributing to the betterment of my workplace and society. I am self motivated and disciplined soul. I am always keen to upskill myself by mentoring and coaching others, learning new things ,coming up with creative ideas to improve something, or make something new, analysing complex data in order to draw clear and simple conclusions, leading a team to success, completing a difficult project, and seeing it through to the end, spotting flaws and errors so as to make sure the end result of a project is as good as possible, finding a way to solve a problem, or overcome a challenge whenever I get a chance. I had Internships with SkillVoid, where I learnt Data Science and gained some valuable industry knowledge. My Strengths are my analytical approach, my human touch to the situations, my communication and presentation skills. I beleive in being realistic. 

          In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, sometimes cooking, lestening music, singing, doing drama, reading motivational books, travelling and playing outdoor sports.</p>
